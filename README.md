Automated Factual-Claim Detection in Danish Broadcasting

This project is part of the Deep Learning course at Technical University of Denmark, taught by professor Ole Winther. 
The project revolves around an automated "claim"-detection system based on subtitles from the danish TV-show "Debatten". The found claims are used later by the fact-checking TV-program "Detektor".
